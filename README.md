# NATIONAL ART CENTRE TOKYO
National Art Center Tokyo (Roppongi Hills) has Japan's largest
 exhibition space and serves as a venue for various art exhibitions.
Opened in January 2007 and designed by the architect Kisho Kurokawa,
 it is a $300 million architectural marvel with lots of gallery space
 and a stunning glass facade, said to resemble
 a tsunami wave, augmented by beautifully-landscaped entrance.
The only thing its lacks thus far are exhibits of art worthy to fill it.

The art center (known as NACT for short) contains 14,000 square meters of 
exhibition space: 10 exhibitor rooms, each 1,000 square meters in size,
and two 2,000-square-meter special exhibition galleries. The rooms contain
 no pillars, giving the staff flexibility in how they want to set them up
 for displays. The museum will not have a permanent collection. Instead it
 will host high-profile temporary exhibitions and be a focal point for the
 art scene in Tokyo,Japan and the world. The National Art Center doesn't
 have its own permanent collection,but is capable of organizing a wide variety
 of artexhibitions,in addition to artist associations and competition exhibitions 
unique to Japan. The building is the last museum designed by the architect, 
Kisho Kurokawa.On his design Kurokawa told the Asahi Shimbun, “Architecture that
 creates ambiguity and a little bit of confusion makes people think, or
 makes them go into a maze. In the design for the NACT, I use several ambiguities.
 The first one is the ambiguity of interior and exterior.
The second way is high-tech and primitive." Among the center's greatest delights
 are a bamboo garden located in an unexpected place and interior iron wood
 floor that continues outside the building. Among its high-tech features are
 cleaning robots and lights that brighten and dim when you walk by them.

# FEATURE OF NATIONAL ART CENTRE IN TOKYO
The National Art Center, Tokyo is a new type of art museum. While it does not have
 a permanent collection, it makes use of its exhibition space, one of the largest 
in Japan (14,000 m²), to hold a variety of exhibitions. It also functions as an art
 center, educating the public and collecting, publishing, and providing information
 and materials related to art. The building and its design have a flexibility that 
allows them to be adapted to a wide range of activities and creative expressions.
NACT is a highly functional gallery facility that can hold multiple exhibitions
 simultaneously. The atrium of the building is characterized by a giant wavelike
 glass facade and features two large inverted cones. At the top of each inverted 
cone is, respectively, a restaurant and a cafe. Here guests can enjoy the view 
through the glass facade. Trees have been planted around the building to blend
 in with the surrounding greenery, and the atrium area is a space that links 
the museum to the nightlife of the Roppongi district as well as to nearby events
 and activities.
